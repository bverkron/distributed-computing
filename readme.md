**Precursor / Disclaimer**

When running a host for a distributed computing platform such as FluidStack or QBlocks on your machine you should assume there are zero steps taken by the provider to protect you or your system as a host. Any such software / install should be assumed to be a security risk.

**Intent**

This is a side project to investigate the security aspects of being a host for a distributed computing platform and experiment with ways to improve it from the host perspective without interfering with the operation of it.
